# Face_Emotion_Detection

In this project, I have implemented a pre-trained model Mobile-Net, fine-tuned using the FER-2013 dataset. The dataset contains 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. 
The dataset includes 28,709 images for the training set and 3,589 images for the test set. In order to deploy the model, I have used OpenCV which takes input face from the webcam 
of the laptop and creates a bounding box around the face of the person and also detects the emotion of the person.
